# Searching through [Soaper.tv](https://soaper.tv/)
The simplest way I could think of through [Soaper.tv](https://soaper.tv/).
Worked on this on exam night and used the technologies from syllabus. \
Might work on this again some other day.

git clone https://github.com/dorkydhruv/search-soaper.tv.git
